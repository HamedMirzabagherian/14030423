**Automatic Hyperparameter tunning based on Hyperas**

Binary cat and dog picture classification projectct using Hyperas toolbox to tune hyperparameters automatically.

In this method, I used Hyperas[2] toolbox that is very helpful to specify the best amount of hyperparameters. I used this in my research[2] and could simply find the best hyperparameters.

The Hyperas toolbox was utilized for the implementation of a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization algorithm. That Hyperas is a very simple convenience wrapper around the Hyper­opt toolbox for fast tuning the models[3]. Among some pre-defined values for each hyperparameter, one is suggested by Hyperas as the best value for that hyperparameter.

It is crucial to note that HYPERAS identifies the optimal hyperparameters, enhancing the model's speed in response time to its maximum potential.

This is the procedures:
1. Installing HYPERAS (Block 12)
2. Require imports (Block 13)
3. Definition model(1) for HYPERAS (Block 14)
4. Saving ipython (Block 15)
5. Running HYPERAS model(1) (Block 16)
6.  Other model(2) of HYPERAS (Block 17)
7. Saving ipython (Block 18)
8. Runnig HYPERAS model(2) (Block 19)



**Note 1**: At the first of each block, some explanation brings to show the role of this.
**Note 2**: all of the model and data must be defined in the form of function.
**Note 3**: the parameters of notebook_name and title must be varied to the name of project.
